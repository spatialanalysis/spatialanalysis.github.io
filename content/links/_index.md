The following are resources that we have found useful in teaching spatial analysis and methods using R. You may find these helpful as a reference. Free resources are denoted with an asterisk.

## Spatial Data Analysis in R

- [**Spatial R Task View**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html)*: Provides an overview of the R ecosystem for spatial data analysis

- [**Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R (2nd Edition)**](https://asdar-book.org/), Roger Bivand, Edzer Pebesma and Virgilio Gomez-Rubio (2013): More advanced, in-depth coverage of spatial statistical packages in R (assumes quite a bit of R expertise)

- [**Geocomputation in R**](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/)*: Recent online textbook about manipulating, mapping, and modeling geographic data

- [**Introduction to visualizing spatial data in R**]([https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/intro-spatial-rl.pdf](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/intro-spatial-rl.pdf))*, Robin Lovelace, James Cheshire, Rachel Oldroyd and others (2015) : A good introductory overview of GIS operations in R

- [**An Introduction to Spatial Data Analysis and Visualization in R**](http://www.spatialanalysisonline.com/An%20Introduction%20to%20Spatial%20Data%20Analysis%20in%20R.pdf)*, Guy Lansley and James Cheshire (2016): A more extensive introduction to mapping, spatial data manipulation and visualization in R

- [**An Introduction to R for Spatial Analysis and Mapping**](https://ocean.sagepub.com/books/an-introduction-to-r-for-spatial-analysis-and-mapping), Chris Brunsdon and Lex Comber (2015): a more in-depth intermediate overview of GIS operations and some spatial analysis in R with lots of illustrations

## General R Learning

- [**R for Data Science**](http://r4ds.had.co.nz)*, Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham (2017): A collection of data science “skills” using R, with an emphasis on “data munging” using specialized R packages called the "tidyverse" – highly recommended if you are serious about data science using R
